# PythonLearning
This is learning lesson on python. I am learning various elements of python such as - strings, Lists, Tuples, dictionary , conditional statements and other operators.

First Question -->
I learned strings, how to take inputs and iterate over string.
Also to implement and access the characters using index.
I learned about various conditional statements such as while loop, for loop and if else statements.

Second Question-->
I learned about list, how to take inputs and iterate over them.
Used some arithmetic operators +, > and other inbuilt function such as abs()

Third Question-->
I learned dictionary, how to implement it.
Studied various function used in dictionary.
Used function-get() to access the Key.

Class and Object-->
I learned about Class and objects, with different types of constructor.Different types of variables: Static and Instance Variable.
I learned the concept of inheritance and also how to make calls to base class and derived class.
In these questions I implemented single level inheritance.
Also I implemented multiple Inheritance and used the concept of Encapsulation,polymorphism and abstract class(method overriding). 

Interface-->
I learned about Interface, formal and informal interface.How Interface is different from abstract class and implemented formal and informal interface.
